About
=====

Ubaryd for Emacs is a port of the [Ubaryd](https://github.com/Donearm/Ubaryd) color scheme for ViM.

This theme uses the built-in theming support available starting with Emacs 24

Installation
============

Download `ubaryd-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/` and add this to your `.emacs`:

	(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")

With this you can load the theme with:

	M-x load-theme RET ubaryd

Bugs, Improvements and Suggestions
==================================

Please report any bugs you find in the Github issue tracker. I'm new to Emacs theming and I'm sure there are many bugs lurking around. Don't hesitate to send patch or pull requests.
